# Hi!

My name is Adam Matan, and I am looking for a technical leadership role (Technical Team Lead, VP R&D or alike) in a startup in Tel Aviv.

# What do I do?
I am a team leader, ex-CTO, Backend developer, and public speaker. I build end-to-end apps using modern cloud tools - from Docker containers to Serverless functions and Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools. I am a polyglot, but my favorite language is Python.

# What do I bring to the table?
* **Team and Business**: As former CTO and DevRel, I understand business goals and build productive communication between the dev team, company leadership, and customers. Experienced in working with developers and partners in the US.
* **Dev**: Practical backend solutions using modern cloud tools - Serverless, AWS, Linux, Python and POSIX languages, and (NO)SQL DBs. GIS experience (PostGIS, GeoPy, QGIS etc.). I use Open-Source and Free Software to build robust products quickly. See my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/51197), [Servefault](https://serverfault.com/users/10904/adam-matan), and [GIS Stack exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/382/adam-matan) profiles.
* **Ops**: Do it once, then twice, then automate! I use CI/CD building blocks - Jenkins, Ansible, AWS Lambda, Docker and others -  to build robust pipelines that accelerate projects and make developers smile.

# What am I looking for?
I am seeking a technical leadership position in a growing startup in Tel Aviv, with a positive impact on our world. Interacting with customers and product - a great plus.
