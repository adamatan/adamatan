# What am I looking for?
A leadership position in a hyper-growing, well-funded startup with or nearing a product-market fit.

Feel free to be in touch even if your company does not exactly fit the profile. Surprising things happen at coffee meetings.

# What do I do?
I am an R&D manager, developer, and public speaker. My teams build end-to-end apps using modern tools - from AWS, containers and serverless functions all the way to React and web workers.

# Experience
R&D Manager at [Zoomin Software](https://www.zoominsoftware.com/), R&D Manager at [Wix.com](https://wix.com), DevRel and Developer at [Reshuffle](https://www.reshuffle.com/) (now part of Twitter), CTO at [Vioozer](https://www.vioozer.com/), IFS/BE Developer at [Waze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze) and [Yahoo!](https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/yahoo-dapper/).

# What do I bring to the table?
* **Team and Business**: As an R&D manager and former CTO and DevRel, I understand business goals and build productive communication between the dev team, company leadership, and customers. I am experienced in working with developers and partners in the US.

* **Dev**: Practical backend solutions using modern cloud tools - Serverless, AWS, Linux, Python and POSIX languages, and (NO)SQL DBs. GIS experience (PostGIS, GeoPy, QGIS etc.). I use Open-Source and Free Software to build robust products quickly. See my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/51197), [Servefault](https://serverfault.com/users/10904/adam-matan), and [GIS Stack exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/382/adam-matan) profiles.
* **Ops**: Do it once, then twice, then automate! I use CI/CD building blocks - ArgoCD, GH Actions, Docker, AWS Lambda, Kubernetes and others -  to build robust pipelines that accelerate projects and make developers smile.
