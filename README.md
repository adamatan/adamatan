# Hi!

My name is Adam Matan, and I am an R&D manager at Wix.com in Tel Aviv.

# What do I do?
I am a software group leader, developer, and public speaker. My teams build end-to-end apps using modern cloud tools - from Docker containers and serverless functions to React components.

# What do I bring to the table?
* **Team and Business**: As an R&D manager and former CTO and DevRel, I understand business goals and build productive communication between the dev team, company leadership, and customers. I am experienced in working with developers and partners in the US.

* **Dev**: Practical backend solutions using modern cloud tools - Serverless, AWS, Linux, Python and POSIX languages, and (NO)SQL DBs. GIS experience (PostGIS, GeoPy, QGIS etc.). I use Open-Source and Free Software to build robust products quickly. See my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/51197), [Servefault](https://serverfault.com/users/10904/adam-matan), and [GIS Stack exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/382/adam-matan) profiles.
* **Ops**: Do it once, then twice, then automate! I use CI/CD building blocks - Jenkins, Ansible, AWS Lambda, Docker and others -  to build robust pipelines that accelerate projects and make developers smile.

# What am I looking for?
I am an R&D manager at Wix since May 2019. I am happy with my role and I'm not seeking an immediate career move.
I will be happy to schedule a phone call and talk about opportunities and my career path, but I feel it's important to correlate our mutual expectations. It's going to be about getting to know each other for the future to come, and not for a move right now.

 My next role is hopefully a VP R&D in a growing startup in Tel Aviv.
